## üìö What I Learned
This project helped me practice creating a clean, modern card component with interactive hover states. Key learnings include:

- Using CSS custom properties for consistent color theming
- Implementing smooth hover transitions and overlay effects
- Creating responsive layouts that work across different screen sizes
- Proper semantic HTML structure for accessibility
- Working with the Outfit font family and different font weights

```css
/* Example: Hover overlay effect */
.image-overlay {
  position: absolute;
  background-color: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}

.card-image:hover .image-overlay {
  opacity: 1;
}
```
